            "For CometBid projects (and the open source world in general), committers are the ones who hold the keys. Committers decide what code goes into the code base, they decide how a project builds, and they ultimately decide what gets delivered to the adopter community. Committer status is assigned following a demonstration of merit (generally a record of high-quality contribution to a project) and a successful committer election.",
            "The specific agreements required depends on the nature of the project. For committers on an open source software project (i.e., most CometBid Foundation projects), the traditional agreements are required. For committers on an open source specification project, additional working group agreements are required.",
            "Committer status is assigned on a project-by-project basis. That is, individuals have committer rights only on those projects for which they hold committer status. For all other projects, they are contributors.",
            "Our committer provisioning process is automated: new committers will—following their successful election—be contacted by email to engage in our agreement workflow (also referred to as our paperwork process), which guides them through signing those agreements that they need. The agreements are provided below for convenience."

As part of this process, the Foundation organizes member community reviews for projects to ensure consistent interaction between the projects and the broader membership.",

                                    <div className="text-title">1. What are Cometbid Foundation Interest Groups?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">Cometbid Foundation Interest Groups facilitate the collaboration between participating CometBid Member organisations to drive shared innovation. CometBid Interest Groups are a light-weight association of a subset of Members that can come together to share a common interest in a topic or domain in a vendor-neutral manner based on the Cometbid Foundation&#39;s overall governance structure including its antitrust policy.</div>
                                </div>

                                <div id="section2" className="content-details">
                                    <div className="text-title">2. Does this mean CometBid offers two mechanisms by which it supports industry collaborations?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">Yes, the Cometbid Foundation now offers two mechanisms to foster open industry collaboration to develop and drive new industry platforms and initiatives. Like CometBid Working Groups, CometBid Interest Groups can also collaborate across organizational boundaries in a vendor-neutral structure to solve industry problems and to drive shared innovation.</div>
                                </div>

                                <div id="section3" className="content-details">
                                    <div className="text-title">3. What are the major differences between Interest Groups and Working Groups? How do I choose which is right for my initiative?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">Interest Groups, while modeled after Working Groups, are a very light-weight/self-governed group. Participation in Interest Groups is self managed by Member organisations, and there are no formal participation agreements, budgets, or committees. In short, they provide a simpler mechanism for Member organisations to collaborate in a collegial, vendor-neutral manner on initiatives of shared interest.</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">Working Groups are intended for industry collaborative initiatives that have the intent to invest in the collective initiative, typically via participation fees. The intent is for working groups to address such additional objectives as developing and promoting a joint brand, developing open source specifications, contributing resources to drive common roadmaps and/or platforms, etc.</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">From a pragmatic point of view, Working Groups leverage the Cometbid Foundation Working Group Process to manage and drive the collaboration, and have Participation Agreements, Working Group Fees, Charters,Committees, Program Plans, Budgets, and so on. Interest Groups, on the other hand, due to their lighter-weight structure, have none of these.</div>
                                </div>

                                    <div className="content-details">Existing members may propose to create an Interest Group by starting the process here. If your organisation is not already a member, you must first join the Cometbid Foundation, and then follow the same process. Note that all participating member organisations must have also executed the CometBid Member Committer and Contributor Agreement.</div>

                                    <div className="text-title">5. How many members are required in order to create an Interest Group?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">There must be at least three Member organisations participating. Each Interest Group must designate one or more Interest Group Leads.</div>

                                    <div className="content-details">No, Interest Groups do not require Members to pay any additional fees to participate. However, you must be a Member of the Cometbid Foundation to participate. For more information, please visit our Membership Page.</div>

                                    <div className="content-details">Existing members with an executed CometBid Member Committer and Contributor Agreement may participate in any Interest Group of interest. Members may participate by declaring participation via the Interest Group&#39;s mailing list.</div>

                                    <div className="text-title">8. What is the governance structure of an Interest Group?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">The governance structure for Interest Groups is intentionally lightweight. CometBid Interest Groups inherit and rely upon the Cometbid Foundation&#39;s overall governance, sufficient to enable individuals from Member organisations to collaborate effectively while conforming to all CometBid processes and policies, including the Cometbid Foundation Intellectual Property and Antitrust Policies. See the Interest Group Process for a full overview of applicable related governance documents.</div>

                                    <div className="text-title">9. How do Interest Groups make decisions?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">Most actions taken by Interest Groups should be done so collegially by participants and based on lazy consensus. However, the Cometbid Foundation Interest Group Process does include a means for decisions to be formalized, should the participants believe it is valuable to do so.</div>
                                </div>

                                <div id="section10" className="content-details">

                                    <div className="text-title">11. Can Interest Groups create specifications and/or develop software?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">No, Interest Groups cannot create specifications nor develop software. Interest Groups may, at their discretion, produce artifacts such as documents, whitepapers, architectures, blueprints, diagrams, presentation and the like; however, they must not develop software, software documentation, or specifications.</div>

                                    <div className="text-title">12. Are Interest Groups a Prerequisite to becoming a Working Group?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">No, Interest Groups are not a prerequisite to becoming a Working Group. It is possible, however, for the members of an Interest Group to decide to create a new Working Group.</div>
                                </div>

                                    <div className="text-title">13. Can Interest Groups graduate to Working Groups?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">There is no direct correlation between Interest Groups and Working Groups, and thus no notion of graduation. Rather, all CometBid industry collaborations, be they Interest Groups or Working Groups, will persist for however long they serve the collective purpose of their Members. It is possible that, over time, the Members of a particular Interest Group may deem that it would be more useful to be constituted as a Working Group, and vice versa. Should this be the case, it is possible under the guidance of the Foundation&#39;s staff to make such a change.</div>
                                </div>

                                    <div className="text-title">14. Are Interest Groups the same as Special Interest Groups SIGs?</div>
                                    <div className="content-details">While similar, they are different. Special Interest Groups are a collaborative governance structure that allows Members of a working group to collaborate on specific, focused aspects of the broader working group&#39;s scope. As such, Members of a SIG must also be participants of the Working Group which has formed the SIG.</div>

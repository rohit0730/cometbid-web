Commonly referred to as “open innovation,” this paradigm encourages collaboration across organizational boundaries, and is often practiced in the open source community. Working groups allow organizations to combine the best practices of open source development with a set of services required for open innovation, enabling organizations to foster industry collaborations.</div>

The collaboration promotes and augments Eclipse technologies to meet the needs of specific industries and communities, including through the development and implementation of joint marketing programs to increase awareness, adoption, and contributions.

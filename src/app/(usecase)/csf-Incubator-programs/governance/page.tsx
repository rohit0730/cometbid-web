                <p className="mb-3">The CometBid Project currently has separate incubation components under three of its sub-projects: Equinox, Platform, and PDE. Although these components are successfully being used for exploratory/experimental/forward-looking development, they are constrained (because they are located within their respective projects) to follow the strictest IP guidelines.</p>
                <p>In addition, the expectation is that the remaining Cometbid sub-project, JDT, will require an incubator area in the near future.</p>
